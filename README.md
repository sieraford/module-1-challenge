# Module 1 Challenge: Horiseon Site Refactor

## Description

I refactored the existing Horiseon site to make it more accessible. It is important for sites to be made accessible because it helps users with disabilites consume the content and also helps sites be better positioned in search engines. 

In addition to making the site more accessible, I also fixed broken links and reorganized the structure of the CSS file to improve the codebase for long-term sustainability. 

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).
