# Module 1 Challenge: Horiseon Site Refactor

## Description

I refactored the existing Horiseon site to make it more accessible. It is important for sites to be made accessible because it helps users with disabilites consume the content and also helps sites be better positioned in search engines. 

In addition to making the site more accessible, I also fixed broken links and reorganized the structure of the CSS file to improve the codebase for long-term sustainability.

## Usage

You can click the links in the navigation bar to learn more about each topic. If you open the DevTools console, you can see the webpage meets accessiblity standards. If you view the source code, you will find semantic HTML elements that follow a logical structure, accesible alt attributes on the images, heading attributes that fall in sequiential order and a concise, descriptive title.
